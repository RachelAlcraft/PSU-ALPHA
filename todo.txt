As per StrBio practical 8, when adding hydrogens in Chimera
Select  Select All
Tools  Structure Editing  Add H
Hydrogens are in the structure like
ATOM   1566  N   GLY   103      17.773  21.088   2.351  1.00 62.54           N
ATOM   1567  CA  GLY   103      17.150  22.161   1.621  1.00 62.54           C
ATOM   1568  C   GLY   103      17.355  22.049   0.145  1.00 62.54           C
ATOM   1569  O   GLY   103      18.393  21.585  -0.316  1.00 62.54           O
ATOM   1570  H   GLY   103      18.769  20.919   2.338  1.00  0.00           H
ATOM   1571  HA2 GLY   103      17.573  23.106   1.961  1.00  0.00           H
ATOM   1572  HA3 GLY   103      16.080  22.157   1.831  1.00  0.00           H
Need to be able to do something with that.

Need to add OXT and any other way of knowing that an atom is a terminating atom in a structure

There are some non standard amino acids that must be in the files that failed, so go though those files.

I need to scrap the pdb format and use cif: http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/sw-examples/cpp/html/index.html

Do I need any sort of probability analysis in c++ or only produce the data for all analysis in R? Just worried about speed.
